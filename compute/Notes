Ec2
In Cloud anything start with small either compute,storage and expand it based on the usage 
Despite being a pay-as-you-go model, there are nuances like the one you've experienced: 
provisioned resources (like an allocated but unused EBS volume or a running EC2 instance) are billed regardless of their active use because they are reserved for your use and thus incur costs. 
To manage costs effectively, it's important to actively manage these resources, shutting down or resizing them as needed to align with your actual usage.
Make sure ur instance and storage need to present in the same region
Suppose if ur storage and ec2 present in diff availability zone u need to take snapshot of that storage and need to add in ec2 instance availability zone
